# Hello Get

## Some Hi-Hello with Get, Flutter's No. 1 most liked package.
- In this practice project, I created a counter app that increase, decrease, reset and add X and Y value.
- Int, RxInt and RxList data type is used
- Sum button adds current X and Y value and shows it on top
- It also adds the sum value in a list(RxList)
- The list can be shown by a snackbar, which appears on clicking the calculate button on right top
- The Reset button resets X, Y and list
- All value's are passed through different screens
